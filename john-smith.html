        <h2>OFFICIAL RULING</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause of Death:</strong> Acute stress-induced cardiac event secondary to "Notification Overload Syndrome (NOS).</p>
        <p><strong>Medical Determination:</strong> Subject experienced chronic psychological stress from unmanageable volume of digital notifications (2,847 unread Jira notifications). The attempt to manage notifications triggered a system error generating 89 additional notifications simultaneously, causing acute stress response that led to fatal cardiac event.</p>
        <p><strong>Contributing Factors:</strong> 18-hour work days, 4-5 hours sleep per night, notification anxiety, inability to disconnect from work systems, lack of work-life boundaries. Subject's perfectionist tendencies and inability to ignore notifications created a feedback loop of increasing stress.</p>
        <p><strong>Ruling:</strong> Work-related fatality. Occupational Safety and Health Administration notified. Case highlights need for digital workplace wellness policies and notification management systems.</p>
